# Mathematical Model of a Personalized Neoantigen Cancer Vaccine and the Human Immune System: Evaluation of Efficacy

Cancer vaccines are an important component of the cancer immunotherapy toolkit, enhancing the immune response to malignant cells by activating CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells.  We present a mechanistic mathematical model describing key interactions of a personalized neoantigen cancer vaccine with the immune system of an individual patient. The model considers the vaccine concentration of tumor-specific antigen peptides and adjuvant, patient's major histocompatibility complexes I and II copy numbers, tumor size, T-cells, and antigen presenting cells. Model simulations predict both immune responses to the vaccine as well as clinical outcome. Our model has the potential to lay the foundation for generating in silico clinical trial data and aid the development and efficacy assessment of personalized cancer vaccines.

### Requirements to run code here:
- Wolfram Mathematica 12.0 (or most recent)
- To run this code (Shift+Enter to execute each cell):
    1. Download data from this repository (Patients_HLA_BA.xlsx, Tcellscounts.xlsx, and Best-fit_param.xlsx)
    2. Initialize by executing 'Initalization' cell
    3. Estimate patients' tumor size 
    4. Now you can solve the ODE system
